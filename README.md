## Features
The Macro preprocessor supports :
1. Single-line macro
2. Multi-line macro
3. Nested macro
4. Comment lines (for all the given three languages)
5. Un-defining and Re-defining of macro
6. Conditional macro
7. As many numbers of parameters and variables.

If given more number of parameters than defined, it will accept the first 'n' number of arguments, where 'n' is the defined no of parameters.


## Macro Definition

1. Single-line Macro : 
    ```
    @MACRO<space>[name]<space>:
    ```
2. Multi-line Macro : 
    ```
    @MACRO<space>[name]<space>:-[{‚Ä¶}]
    ```
3. Un-defining Macro :
    ```
	%undef $[label]
    ```
4. Re-defining Macro :
    ```
	%redef $[label]
    ```
5. Conditional Macro :
    ```
	%ifdef $[label] 
	%ifndef $[label]
    ```

    \* [label] is the ordered number of defined macros.
